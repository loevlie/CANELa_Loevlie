Welcome to CANELa_Loevlie documentation!
===================================

**CANELa_Loevlie** is a collection of python codes for members of the CANELa lab to understand how to use and improve upon Denny Loevlie's work from 2021-2022.

This `documentation <https://github.com/loevlie/CANELa_Loevlie/>`_ will explain and provide examples for how to perform various tasks using the code developed in the CANELa group.  This will involve use of the `ce_expansion <https://github.com/mpourmpakis/ce_expansion/>`_ package developed mainly by James Dean and Michael Cowan.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
