Welcome to the Denny Docs!
===================================

**CANELa_Loevlie** is a collection of Python codes for members of the CANELa lab.  The hope is this documentation will help users understand and improve upon Dennis Loevlie's work from 2021-2022.

This `documentation <https://github.com/loevlie/CANELa_Loevlie/>`_ will explain and provide examples for how to perform various tasks using the code developed in the CANELa group.  This will involve use of the `ce_expansion <https://github.com/mpourmpakis/ce_expansion/>`_ package developed mainly by James Dean and Michael Cowan and the 
`CANELa_NP <https://github.com/mpourmpakis/canela_np/>`_ and `cp2k_helper <https://github.com/loevlie/cp2k_helper>`_ packages developed by Dennis Loevlie.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
the :ref:`installation` instructions for the project.
